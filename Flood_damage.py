The damage factors shown below are applied to define the damage in low-frequency flooded areas.
The damage factors are based on the damage factors from the Dutch government (Rijkswaterstaat, 2004).
Parameters used in the functions are:

- u = flow rate (m/s)
- ukr = critical flow rate (m/s)
- w = rise rate (m/hour)
- Î² = material factor
